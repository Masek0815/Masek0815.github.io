<p>If you read about the current situation in Iran, you will quickly encounter wildly different assessments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The End of The Mullahs’ Regime in Iran Is Near&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Son of ousted shah says he’s ‘prepared to return to Iran’ at first opportunity&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Here’s Why the Iranian Regime Seems Invincible&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are just a few of todays headlines on the same topic. <em>The only thing this conveys with any certainty is that we don’t know shit.</em></p>
<p>There is no KPI showing when a regime is about to fall. If there were, the CIA would be perfect in predicting revolutions. But usually they are taken by surprise like everyone else.</p>
<p>This article is an attempt to explain why&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="protests-dont-topple-regimes-an-organized-opposition-does">Protests don&rsquo;t topple regimes: an organized opposition does</h3>
<p>Protesters are not, by themselves, good at toppling regimes. They can be extremely useful to actors trying to overthrow those in power, but protests only rarely determine who will actually be in charge tomorrow.</p>
<p>In order to take over a country, you need first and foremost a political organization capable of governing. A mob cannot rule. Without an organization that can actually take over, there will be no new government.</p>
<p>One key feature of authoritarian regimes is that they do not allow their opponents to organize. As a result, any opposition has to organize in secret. As a result, two very different situations look very similar from the outside:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no organized opposition, so we don&rsquo;t see any.</li>
<li>There is a well organized opposition that is highly capable of maintaining secrecy.</li>
</ul>
<p>One situation is genuinely dangerous for the regime; the other is not. The challenge is telling one from the other.</p>
<h3 id="the-internal-state-of-the-regime-matters">The internal state of the regime matters</h3>
<p>Usually, a regime does not fall because of the strength of its opposition, but because of a lack of support. Maintaining a regime is hard and active work.</p>
<p>A functional regime requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>people to control and censor the media,</li>
<li>a riot police and a secret police,</li>
<li>strong oversight of all state functions,</li>
<li>and a lot more.</li>
</ul>
<p>A regime falls when that support is no longer there, and the opposition can exploit the resulting cracks and crevices to pry power away from it.</p>
<p>It is absolutely essential for any authoritarian regime to make internal support appear to be at its best. While it may punish any dissent at all, it will crack 10 times as hard on any dissent within it’s own ranks and everyone knows that. So even nominal supporters on the verge of deserting the regime will continue to profess their loyalty.</p>
<p>As a result, the internal state of an authoritarian regime is extremely opaque.</p>
<h3 id="rewards-and-punishment">Rewards and punishment</h3>
<p>An authoritarian regime in power usually has two major advantages for maintaining its support:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can reward its followers</li>
<li>If can punish its opponents</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as a regime maintains these two capabilities, it will have no trouble finding goons willing to fight for it. This holds true in Minneapolis as well as in Tehran.</p>
<p>Any regime uses sticks and carrots to ensure that its nominal supporters actively support it. These functions are absolutely essential, and an authoritarian regime will sooner allow hunger among the masses than risk losing these tools.</p>
<p>That makes it hard to judge when a regime will lose its ability to reward or punish.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-the-morale-of-a-regime">Breaking the morale of a regime</h3>
<p><strong>The disadvantage of a regime is that it has to reward its followers and punish its opponents.</strong> While a rebel only expects a reward after victory, a government agent has immediate and tangible demands.</p>
<p>The system starts to collapse once supporters lose their belief in the regime’s ability to make good on its promises and its threats. Anyone who has lost that belief knows they are in immediate danger. That person will do anything to conceal the fact.</p>
<p>So a system that is about to fall is like a poker table full of people holding poor cards and bluffing as if their lives depend on it, which they do. You may be able to feel this if you are one of the people at the table. But you will have no clue if you are just watching TV coverage thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>As a result, the people with the deepest insight into the severity of the regime’s situation have the strongest reasons to keep quiet about it.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>There is no reliable external indicator that will tell you that a regime is about to be toppled.</p>
<p><strong>Once you see clear signs, it has already happened.</strong></p>
