    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>After spending way too much time in discussions, workshops, and conferences lately, let me give you my breakdown on AI &amp; Security.</p>
<p>The problem with this topic is that it isn&rsquo;t one single topic. What I see is multiple distinct discussions rolled into a single convoluted mess: one that obscures far more than it clarifies.</p>
<p>So let me deflate this overheated discourse and break it down into four parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Attackers using AI</strong> to build better malware</li>
<li><strong>Defenders using AI</strong> to stop attacks</li>
<li><strong>Protecting an AI itself</strong> from being attacked</li>
<li><strong>Protecting the infrastructure</strong> that runs the AI</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s still an over-simplification, but it&rsquo;ll have to do for now. Let&rsquo;s take these apart one by one.</p>
<h3 id="attackers-using-ai-to-build-better-malware"><strong>Attackers using AI</strong> to build better malware</h3>
<p>This is the most hyped topic. If you read the panic-stricken media, the average conclusion is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI is outputting extremely dangerous new malware at an incredible pace. If you do not have your own counter-AI in place to defend, you are hopelessly outclassed. The attacker just presses a button, a fully automated attack at nation state attacker level fires off against your company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is one partially correct sub-statement in there: the high pace. Let us take a look at the most advanced contemporary malware that was probably written by an AI: <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2026/voidlink-early-ai-generated-malware-framework/">Voidlink</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of techniques used by the malware, we see nothing out of the ordinary. There is no magic silver bullet to defeat current defenses. What we see is a recombination of known methods and fragments. If you were protected against those threats before, the AI usage by the attacker will not pose a new threat.</p>
<p><strong>BUT:</strong> If your defensive capabilities were outclassed before, your pain level will rise soon and quickly. Voidlink was created most likely by a small but experienced team to a challenging level within a few weeks. The threat to you comes therefore not from quality but by improved quantity of potential attackers.</p>
<p>The logical next step I expect is for attackers to integrate autonomous agentic capabilities into their malware for lateral movement. This is where an attacker will most likely benefit from an improvement of speed.</p>
<p>The silver lining? A good defensive measure is to detect and govern AI usage within your own enterprise, and that is something you should do anyway. The reasons are plentiful: legal, risk management, compliance, and more.</p>
<h3 id="defenders-using-ai-to-stop-attacks"><strong>Defenders using AI</strong> to stop attacks</h3>
<p>This is the most boring topic. Why? In case your defenses are even close to the current state of the art, they will be using a lot of AI already. You just don&rsquo;t recognise it, as not every implementation of AI is a chatbot.</p>
<p>The technologies to build contemporary AI have long been used to identify and analyze threats. Pattern recognition and neural networks have not magically appeared together with the chatbot. This has been happening for over a decade and will continue.</p>
<p>Talking about AI in cyber defenses as something new is like bragging about inventing fire.</p>
<p>So if we look at the chatbot as one aspect of AI: what can it do to help you in terms of cyber security?</p>
<p>My predictions here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The chatbot can be used as an interface between the cybersecurity team and the users of a company. This will result in better tickets and change requests, freeing the team from being the company&rsquo;s resident explainer-in-chief and letting them get back to their actual jobs.</li>
<li>The technology can be leveraged to build a living documentation that actually stays updated. It is a very obvious step to improve coverage, quality, and speed of documentation using a chatbot.</li>
<li>The chatbot is predestined to become the ultimate internal search engine. Being much better at localizing information in the data graveyard enterprises tend to become, it can greatly help getting operational staff to the relevant document faster.</li>
<li>Context makes or breaks the call when deciding if something fishy is going on. Using chatbots to enrich information can be one of the most impactful applications of AI in the security business.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this comes for free. Even paying for your chatbot subscriptions is not enough. All of this requires proper planning and integration. It is trivial to integrate a chatbot that looks great but doesn&rsquo;t improve productivity. The core is that you either understand how to approach these topics or work with someone who does. Just writing half a dozen lines of pre-prompt will win you no prizes.</p>
<p>And a word of caution: any AI support in such tasks condenses work. It does not make your team superhuman. You must keep an eye on the wear and tear it takes on people suddenly working more tickets per day. The productivity gain of a good implementation will be real, but so is an increased burnout risk.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-an-ai-against-an-attack"><strong>Protecting an AI</strong> against an attack</h3>
<p>Any new IT technology has its own security risks. That is also true for AI. Getting an AI to say stupid, wrong, or even secret things has become such a popular pastime that there is even an online game for it: <a href="https://gandalf.lakera.ai/">Gandalf by Lakera</a>. The dominant (but not only) attack vector even has a name: prompt injection.</p>
<p>Most contemporary chatbots in their default configuration are an incredibly easy target. Progress is being made, but making a chatbot with access to private or dangerous information accessible to external users is currently a risky move. There are <a href="https://garak.ai">freely available toolsets</a> designed to systematically exploit AI vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a plethora of defensive solutions has appeared, of varying quality. The important facts are: nothing is perfect or free. You pay with latency, compute, and licenses, and usually the investment buys you an improvement but not invulnerability.</p>
<p>So as always in IT security, you have to balance things:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the risks (e.g. what information does the AI have access to)? Which restrictions are given to you by a regulatory framework?</li>
<li>How much value do you derive from the solution at all?</li>
</ul>
<p>And then the cold math of IT security kicks in:</p>
<ul>
<li>The security solution must not cost more than the risk it mitigates</li>
<li>You minimize the costs of: security solution plus remaining risks</li>
<li>In the end the total costs must not exceed the value derived from the AI use</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is why we currently see so many unsafe AI deployments: if there is no significant value extracted from the AI deployment, there is no budget for a security solution. So a lot of deployments are based solely on the hope that no serious damage will occur.</p>
<p>On that note: people who let an AI agent work on their email folder without a dedicated AI protection deserve what will happen to them.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-the-infrastructure-of-an-ai-against-an-attack"><strong>Protecting the infrastructure</strong> of an AI against an attack</h3>
<p>There is an old army joke: The Artillery knows neither friend nor foe, only targets. Well, with AI we are building what can only be called a &ldquo;very juicy&rdquo; target: expensive compute power sitting alongside mountains of data, ripe for the taking.</p>
<p>Once we get to the training side of an AI, it becomes even more attractive. The amount of manipulated data necessary to poison the training of an AI is surprisingly small.</p>
<p>On the other side, the development of AI infrastructure is primarily driven by speed. Quick development and frequent updates are basic premises, not accidental side effects.</p>
<p>Wherever I have looked behind the smoke screen of modern interfaces, I have seen Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster cobbled together of Python scripts, modules found on the Internet, and a management infrastructure with blind trust as load-bearing element. If you&rsquo;re short on API keys and tokens, you find ample supply in Github repositories.</p>
<p>The only good news is: that is not a new problem introduced by AI. It is just that the shiny stuff often prevents people from seeing the classic IT security problems behind it.</p>
<p>As usual, I expect that we need something bad to happen for us to accept this fact. It doesn&rsquo;t take rocket science to secure this: least privilege execution, fine-grained segmentation combined with zero trust principles would go a long way to mitigate this threat. Unluckily, it still has to be implemented, and if it stands in the way of a quick release, it currently gets the boot.</p>
<p>And please don&rsquo;t assume that your preferred AI vendor takes care of this problem for you. If you read the terms and conditions, you will in most cases discover that the responsibility has been squarely placed upon your shoulders. You just haven&rsquo;t read that far yet.</p>
<h3 id="summary-and-conclusion">Summary and conclusion</h3>
<p>So, what now?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve made it this far, congratulations. You now know more about AI and security than most people who confidently post about it on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s recap: AI does not fundamentally change the game. It accelerates it. Attackers get faster, not smarter. Defenders have been using AI for years without making a fuss about it. The AI itself is a soft target that needs protection. And the infrastructure behind it is held together by the digital equivalent of duct tape and good intentions.</p>
<p>The pattern is familiar to anyone who has been in IT security for more than a few years: a shiny new technology arrives, everyone loses their minds, and the boring fundamentals get ignored in the stampede. Then something breaks, and suddenly everyone rediscovers that segmentation, least privilege, and reading the terms and conditions are not optional.</p>
<p>My advice? Don&rsquo;t panic, but don&rsquo;t sleepwalk either. Get your basics right. Govern your AI usage before a regulator does it for you. And for the love of all that is holy, read what your vendor&rsquo;s contract actually says before you hand over the keys.</p>
<p>AI is a tool. A powerful one, sure. But so is a chainsaw, and nobody lets an intern run one unsupervised&hellip;. Well, almost nobody. Or at least a few don&rsquo;t.</p>
