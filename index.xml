      <description>Paula Volsky has written some of the best fantasy novels I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read. But she is also some kind of enigma for me. There is no writer on whose book I&amp;rsquo;ve spent so much time chasing them down.</description>

      <description>Computer games are said to be profiting from the current stay-at-home guidelines. This is a bit strange because until a few weeks ago, for many people they were widely considered to be of evil. As you may guess, I always thought this to be ridiculous. There may be a lot of bad games out there, but there are also gems like &amp;lsquo;The Witcher 3&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Problems without a solution can be dangerous. The Corona virus pandemic is an example for such a problem. We have approaches for a mitigation (keeping your distance, home office, etc) but no solution (e.g. vaccine or effective medication). So problems without solution are bad. But strangely solutions without problems may also be a problem.</description>

      <description>I seem to be doing the Corona thing all wrong. I&amp;rsquo;m reading about people watching more Netflix and playing computer games. On the Netflix side I&amp;rsquo;m a complete looser at the moment. I&amp;rsquo;ve watched perhaps two episodes in the last four weeks, but I want continue with Uthred, son of Uthred next week. Gaming-wise I&amp;rsquo;m a bit better though I have less time and desire to play than before Corona. Spending so many business hours in my man-cave in the basement seems to spoil it a bit.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender.&amp;rsquo; The famous line from Abba refers to a point in time (1815), where the political landscape changed drastically. The French revolution seemed to have lost and the ancien regime took over again. But the people had experienced a different world they could and would not forget. As they could not express their more radical thoughts outwardly, they headed for safer pastures, more inward. This led to a new art style that nowadays is referred to as &amp;lsquo;Biedermeier&amp;rsquo;. Maybe in 100 years, Corona too will be the name of an art style, epoch or philosophy (or even all of it).</description>

      <description>It is usual for me to return from work quite tired. Nevertheless the Home Office is even more exhausting. I find myself surprised at the fact that I end nearly every day with completely drained batteries. When reading about all the record numbers of players, I feel a twinge of envy. The holidays around easter arrive just in time for me to catch some breath.</description>

Now with holding the campaigns online, this has become even more important. So how to create a nice fantasy map? I need one (and quickly) for my session this afternoon.</description>

      <description>In the current crisis, I am lucky in several regards. First I am a technology hoarder. With unused stuff alone you could probably run a small company. On the second point I was just switching from one upstream technology (DSL) to the next (Cable). So when the crisis broke out, I postponed the cancellation of the first one. Counting the LTE backup, I now have three lifelines to the world. And last but not least, I enjoy tinkering with it.</description>

      <description>Any offensive relies on the troops being in the shape for it. Especially during the coming weeks and months,  this will be a challenge. For one we are being more and more restricted in terms of movement and the psychological impact (at least on my side) has increased the intake of sweets.</description>

      <description>Very few people have had so much impact on my life as you did: my family, close friends, some teachers in school. But that&amp;rsquo;s it. Together with David Weber, you&amp;rsquo;re the reason I switched my primary reading language from German to English. That had a profound impact on my professional career in which a significant part of all communication is done in English. My patient&amp;rsquo;s provision includes a link to a video with you. But this is only the obvious stuff. The more subtle part is an integral part of my humour and ethics, that even I cannot tell where your influence starts or ends.</description>

      <description>I have already been ranting about passwords several times. They might be there to protect your digital assets but are also a liability. There are a lot of articles about user passwords being easily guessable. Usually they blame the user and his/her stupidity, the inability to select and remember a password. I consider this plain wrong. Most of those errors are enforced by anachronistic and bad password policies.</description>

      <description>The nobel prize seems to be within the grasp of Jon Grady.  Being an academic dropout seems to be no longer a real obstacle since he just implemented his first prototype of a gravity reflection device. While the Wall Street bankers bankrolling his startup don&amp;rsquo;t seem too happy about being misled about the direction of his research, their expert confirms the validity of his claims.</description>

      <description>Directive 51 is the first book of the Daybreak series with currently three novels. The title is derived from from the &amp;lsquo;Executive Directive 51&amp;rsquo;, a Presidential Directive which claims power to execute procedures for continuity of the federal government in the event of a &amp;lsquo;catastrophic emergency&amp;rsquo;. This may give you a &amp;lsquo;slight hint&amp;rsquo; about the direction this book is going.</description>

      <description>The German book market seems to be very interesting at first glance. With a volume of 13 billion US$ in 2011, the average revenue per capita is nearly twice that of the US market. Books have a very long tradition here. But for foreign authors, especially Science Fiction &amp;amp; Fantasy authors, there are some, ahem, let&amp;rsquo;s call them &amp;lsquo;mitigating factors&amp;rsquo;.</description>

As the current discussion about the porn filters in the UK shows, centralized approaches to blocking content don&amp;rsquo;t work. This here is my way of saying &amp;lsquo;Told you so&amp;rsquo;. Though many technologies have changed in those years and many of those site mentioned ceased to exist, the basic mechanisms and therefor the problems of central censorship are still the same. - Martin Seeger, 24th December 2013</description>

      <description>The scenery is somewhat antiquated, the furniture went out of style dozens of years ago, the lamp still has an old fashioned light bulb and the large desk features a typewriter. Half on the desk, covered with a white sheet, lies a body, slumped forward in his chair. In the background one can heard the fading sound of offset printing machines. Footsteps are approaching outside, two people seem to be arguing&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Smoke detectors have been an annoyance to me since from the first time we met. They go off without warning (I had dozens of false alarms already) and they tend to run out off battery typically at 2 a.m. in the morning. In later case, they give off that &amp;lsquo;click&amp;rsquo; sound every ten minutes which you (sleep deprived) can&amp;rsquo;t locate. That entices you to disable all of them. On the other hand, they are cheap life savers. Well, the Nest fixes the cheap price but maintains a lot of the existing problems.</description>

      <description>This watch could be a game changer like the iPhone was. But currently it isn&amp;rsquo;t and it may never come to it. If you look at it through the eyes of an engineer in the Internet area, opportunities for applications keep popping up in head every five minutes. Unluckily, they are currently still confined to that location.</description>

      <description>Sometimes dystopia can introduce itself with a poetic picture. Imagine endless fields of corn, a blue sky with a warm sun. A hovering &amp;lsquo;ship&amp;rsquo; sails through the crop. On it are a few youngsters racing against another team. Seems idyllic, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? But the illusion is soon dispelled.</description>

      <description>Paula Brandon is a pseudonym of Paula Volsky, one of my favourite fantasy authors. She entered my life in the form of a birthday present from Kris nearly two decades ago. Once I read it (a few years later), I started to soak up every book she wrote. Some of them were really hard to get by, but luckily at that time some obscure web site for books (this one) started to pop up and with it a good source for works out of print. But 2000, every available book was read and I began to wait for new release. I waited. I waited some more. I inquired publishers and even (then already out of style) UseNet groups. Finally, in 2008 I learned from a friend of her, that new books (Hurrah: a trilogy) was coming up. There were three more years to wait, but then the trilogy was published. Thankfully there were only small gaps in the release dates. But the books were well worth waiting for.</description>

      <description>How do you do binge reading without a proper eBook reader? You just don&amp;rsquo;t. Paper based binge reading would (unless you own an English 19th century manor with a library stretching for a complete wing or something like that) fill up your shelf space really quick Trust me, i tried. So i consider eBook readers to be an essential part of the trade. Since the first Kindle Paperwhite ended up with my SO, i used the release of the new edition to switch from my Kindle Touch to the new version.</description>

      <description>This is the first part of the Powder Mage Trilogy, the other parts are still unpublished. So, since i expect the average reader of my blog to like this book, better be prepared for some yearning. But don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid, the next part will be out in February 2014 and two short stories are available to cope with the worst withdrawal symptoms.</description>

      <description>The full title &amp;lsquo;This Town: Two Parties and a Funeral - Plus, Plenty of Valet Parking! - in America&amp;rsquo;s Gilded Capital&amp;rsquo; seems a bit long, but the parties and funerals are an essential part of it while valet parking is somewhat underrepresented. Never mind!</description>

      <description>In 2013, I decided that I would write up some pieces about the books I read. At first I planned to put them on Google+. But I was not very happy about what could be done there in terms of formatting, overview or references to other reviews. So the decision came to start this blog.</description>
