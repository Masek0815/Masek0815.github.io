      <description>According to Wikipedia, &amp;lsquo;Power Projection&amp;rsquo; is a term used in military and political science to refer to the capacity of a state to deploy and sustain forces outside its territory. This ability is a crucial element of a state&amp;rsquo;s power in international relations.  I think one can use the similar term &amp;lsquo;Technology Projection&amp;rsquo; to describe the capacity of an innovative enterprise to deploy and sustain new technology outside their control.</description>

      <description>Buying a bicycle seems to be more difficult than I previously though. Or at least it seems to be more difficult for someone like me.</description>

      <description>100 days are over, but I am still in the home office. And if I read the signs and portents correctly, I also will be for quite some time coming. So I will continue my offensive here.</description>
