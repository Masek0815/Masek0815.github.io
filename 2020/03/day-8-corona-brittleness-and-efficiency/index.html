<p><strong>The last years have been focused on making the economy more efficient. But the corona crisis now shows us the downside of our efficiency. The economic systems in turn have become more brittle.</strong></p>
<p>The last years have been focused on making the economy more efficient. But the corona crisis now shows us the downside of our efficiency. The economic systems in turn have become more brittle.**</p>
<p>Wikipedia says &ldquo;A material is brittle if, when subjected to stress, it breaks with little elastic deformation and without significant plastic deformation.&rdquo; This definition also shows what one property the on opposite side is: Elasticity. So we all love elasticity in our systems, so how can those systems be brittle? Let me explain.</p>
<p>Elasticity is not just a checkbox we click &ldquo;on&rdquo; when we design a system. It comes at a cost. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Services are elastic that have unused resources that can be used to satisfy a higher demand.</li>
<li>Organisation are elastic when people have time they can invest in managing a crisis.</li>
<li>Projects are elastic when there are buffers (in terms of time &amp; material) to deal with unexpected problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Elasticity means not using 100% of the available resources. That is not very efficient. So in order to increase our efficiency, we eliminate non-allocated time of people, CPU cycles or delivery windows. But in turn we do become more brittle. Elasticity also means a system or process bends under stress. It becomes slower to react or may show unfamiliar reactions. This is not a desired property.</p>
<p>So how elastic do we design something? We want it to handle the normal stress without breaking. But what about unusual stress? To plan for how much stress is still economical?</p>
<p>We found very interesting ways to approach this vector:</p>
<ul>
<li>We outsource it: We have a provider who shall provide us with the elasticity to cope with unusual high stress. &ldquo;The contracts will protect us!&rdquo;</li>
<li>We accept the risk: We assign a cost to the (unlikely) case, multiply it by the probability and create reserves to deal with the fallout. &ldquo;Our bank account will save us!&rdquo;</li>
<li>We create pans for a breaking system: We plan for the case of disaster and on how to continue or restart the system in case of a major breakage. &ldquo;We know how to get out of the jam!&rdquo;</li>
<li>And one of the most common one, we ignore it. As we have no way of dealing with the risk without breaking our business case, we prefer to ignore the risk. &ldquo;It will not happen!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually it is not a single approach, but a combination of methods. For example: we have a cloud provider who promises us to increase our resources in case we need them, assign a small probability to the scenario of the cloud provider failing and build reserves for that case, have an emergency plan to move our business to another provider quickly and ignore some scenarios.</p>
<p>This not just true for the small web shop next door who sells handcrafted items, but also for whole national economies. In the competition between nations for wealth our economies have become more and more efficient by using the same means described above. We just increased the scale by several orders of magnitude while maintaining the same coping mechanisms.</p>
<p>Those mechanisms are not as stupid as they sound here. They have been working quite well for some times and have gotten us through some earthquakes, hurricanes and a lot of other disasters. So we used them to become even more efficient. And we have become huge fans of this efficiency. It is nothing short of a miracle that with the click of a mouse we can get nearly every item even from China within a week. After two years that feels like a universal law.</p>
<p>But the permanent drive for efficiency has also produced additional side effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cluster risks: Similar systems can operate more efficient if they are closer to each other.</li>
<li>Cascades: In case of a failure in one system the load is redirected to a similar system.</li>
<li>Inter-dependencies: Every system depends on several others to work with circular dependencies becoming more probable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pharmaceutical companies have similar demands on raw materials or trained people. Though they are competing with each others, they tend to install themselves in close physical proximity.</li>
<li>Cloud services of companies are often to designed to be cloud agnostic. If a cloud provider fails, they can be quickly deployed to the next one.</li>
<li>Mines require complex machinery which is turn fabricated by using ores.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall all systems have become more and more efficient to handle the usual stress.</p>
<p>The corona epidemic is far from being just &ldquo;usual stress&rdquo;. We discover that our usual mitigation strategies do not work on this scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contracts cannot save you from a government ordered shutdown of your provider.</li>
<li>The financial reserves may be calculated for one week or even a month of production outage which causes the company to close.</li>
<li>Disaster recovery plans are designed for one own company to experience a crisis alone and not in concert with several others, competing for the same resources required for a recovery.</li>
<li>Unlikely or impossible scenarios occur now quite frequently</li>
<li>All competing companies producing one good are located close to another and are affected by the same regional outbreak/shutdown.</li>
<li>Failing companies shed their customer base which turn to the competitors and overloading their infrastructure and causing a chain of failures.</li>
</ul>
<p>One property of brittleness is that the work-piece or system at the point of too much stress do not bend but break. That is called &ldquo;catastrophic failure&rdquo;. The affected piece has to be replaced or rebuilt before it can be used again.</p>
<p>Lacking sufficient storage (another inefficiency we got rid off), this requires other systems to work and provide the resources for a restart. The circular dependencies mentioned above may cause overlay systems to fail and make restarts/rebuilds really painful and slow.</p>
<p>And this is why the current crisis worries me. That is also the reason why I am very much in favor of the government intervening and trying to prevent additional failures for financial reasons.</p>
