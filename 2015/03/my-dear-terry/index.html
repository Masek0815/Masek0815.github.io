<blockquote>
<p>KNOCK, KNOCK</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now! Can&rsquo;t you see I am talking to him?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>We met first at the university. I think Achim introduced us. When I mentioned to him, that I like Monty Python, he suggested that you and I should meet. That was during the late 80&rsquo;s. I just had started to roam the Fantasy circles but had not run into you yet. You baited me with a story about the most improbable sorcerer Rincewind and I took it with hook, line and sinker. I still lived at home with my parents, but you moved in with me any way. No big deal; you only needed a bit of shelf space. I could deal with that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KNOCK, KNOCK</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, give us some space here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;HE HAS TO COME WITH ME&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Our first meeting was in Hamburg at Kampnagel. I learned a lot from you that night. About &ldquo;drunk&rdquo; being the universal language of the universe, the importance of fairies in running a nuclear plants in England and how four elderly ladies plundered  an AD&amp;D dungeon. My diaphragm was sore for days, so hard I laughed. There were a few hundred people in the room, but everyone hang on your lips, including me. Instead of giving us bits from your existing universe (&ldquo;You look like students, so you can probably read yourself&rdquo;), we had the impression you created another one for us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KNOCK, KNOCK</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not fair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;THERE IS NO JUSTICE, ONLY ME&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Afterwards you spent some time with us, chatting and signing. I had a large stack of books from friends to be signed. So, when you signed the first one, I went back to the end of the queue to get the next one signed. About 50 people later, I arrived at your table again. To my complete amazement, you noticed me being there again. And you then insisted on signing all books, one after the other.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.ibb.co/Vg5X0F8/terry.jpg"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Vg5X0F8/terry.jpg" alt="Signed by Terry"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>KNOCK, KNOCK</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I DIDN&rsquo;T SPARE THAT ONE EITHER&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>We exchanged a few emails afterwards.  You already used email at a time when it meant running a UUCP site and required using a lot of &ldquo;!&rdquo; to reach someone (not to confused with the use of several consecutive &ldquo;!&rdquo; which is a sign for a deranged mind). You posted on newsgroups long before the Internet became a fad. I always admired your patience with us, who took you as our reporter covering the Diskworld and L-Space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KNOCK, KNOCK</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please!&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>You always kept your humour (the only fracture I ever noticed was when I asked you about the Maggi soup ads in your German book). We knew you were not a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/24/terry-pratchett-angry-not-jolly-neil-gaiman">&ldquo;jolly elf&rdquo;</a> and that the embuggerance was serious. I was dreading this day. But you came out swinging. I can only hope I am up to the same standard when MR. UPPERCASE is trying to arrange a date with me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KNOCK, KNOCK</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, let him write one more book&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;NO&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more page&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;NO&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more sentence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;NO&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Farewell, Sir Terry, I thank you for all you did for me and I miss you dearly.</p>
