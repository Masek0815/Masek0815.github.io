<h2 id="getting-a-pebble">GETTING A PEBBLE</h2>
<p>The Pebble Watch was one of the first projects i backed in April 2012 on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android">Kickstarter</a>. It sold itself to me within seconds. Of all the projects i have backed, this is the one to have the deepest impact on my daily life. A lot of people thought so, with nearly 70.000 backers and over 10 million US$ collected, it was one of the first mega-sellers on the Kickstarter platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Pebble_watch_trio_group_04.png"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Pebble_watch_trio_group_04.png" alt="img"></a></p>
<p>It turned out to be rather complicated to get mine. It should have been shipped in September 2012. The project was delayed (not unexpected), i made a mistake by (initially) choosing a colored one and living in Germany made it even more complicated.</p>
<p>The next mistake on my side was trying to re-route it through the UK, but the Royal Mail foiled that attempt by incompetence. So it took until August 2013 until my Pebble arrived.</p>
<p>At least in the U.S. it seems to be straightforward easy to get one now. The price is 150$ on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> for the black version. Availability in Europe seems to be still spotty at best.</p>
<h2 id="state-of-the-project">STATE OF THE PROJECT</h2>
<p>One would expect that this has given the project a lot of hone firmware and the software around it. In this regard, the status upon arrival was a disappointment. The <em>smartwatch</em> felt essentially restricted to email/sms notifications and exchangeable watch-faces. But the Pebble project was only partially to blame since several constraints were in reality caused by the iPhone with which the Pebble was peered.</p>
<p>This changed with IOS 7 and <a href="https://blog.getpebble.com/2013/11/06/introducing-ios-7-notifications-and-pebble-sdk-2-0/">a new firmware &amp; SDK</a> in early November. Since then, a lot more things are possible that were previously just out of reach. Especially the capability to get every notification on the watch was a huge improvement.</p>
<p>There are third party apps for the Pebble, but the number is far below my expectations. Only watch faces are implemented in abundance. I don&rsquo;t have the impression that third party developers are earning money, the scene seems to be dominated by enthusiasts.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-pebble">USING THE PEBBLE</h2>
<p>So, do I use the Pebble? The answer is <strong>Yes</strong>. So what does it do correctly? Well, they applied the KISS principle correctly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using an e-paper display and by refraining from cramming an over-sized OS into a too small device gives Pebble has a decent battery uptime. Usually i charge it about once a week while not reaching really low charging levels.</li>
<li>The watch looks good and the magnetic coupling for the charging cable is a nice (but not 100% reliable) solution.</li>
<li>Using buttons as UI is a better choice than a too tiny touchscreen (at least for someone with fingers like mine).</li>
</ul>
<p>What applications do I use the Pebble for?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My main benefit results from keeping my iPhone now in silent mode nearly 100% of the time. If it wants to tell me something, it has to go through the Pebble.</p>
<p>This is a bigger improvement than it sounds at first. I no longer miss calls (because the iPhone is silent) or have it ringing at the wrong moments. Having a vibrating watch is impossible to miss but inconspicuous (once you get past the initial jump-a-yard-high-upon-vibrating-stage).</p>
<p>I can even be physically separated from my Smartphone (for a few yards) but still notice incoming messages and calls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My personal killer app is using location based reminders together with the watch. Once i arrive at the supermarket, I get pinged with things I wanted to purchase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vibrating alarm is also an excellent option to wake up early in the morning without disturbing anyone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But that&rsquo;s it, at least currently. Additional apps for the pebble like a step and distance counter are nice gimmicks but do not provide real value-add. Changing the watch-faces is nice to show off but my eyes are worn out by years of binge reading prefer the biggest digits possible to be used. Nice: the accelerometer is used to turn on the background light when you shake your wrist.</p>
<h2 id="weak-points">WEAK POINTS</h2>
<p>There are only a few hard technical points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The watch is 10-20% too big. I am not the smallest person but it still feels a bit over-sized for me. There is room for shrinking the case without reducing the display size.</li>
<li>The peering with (at least with the iPhone) is not 100% stable. The Pebble is shown as two Bluetooth devices (why?). You can get it into a state where you have only partial functionality. Some notifications got lost or delayed while others got through.</li>
<li>The rubber watch band that comes with it is not skin friendly (when there is danger of sweating).</li>
</ul>
<p>But the thing that prevents the Pebble currently from becoming &ldquo;The Next Big Thing&rdquo; is the lack of 110% engineering Steve Jobs has installed at Apple. There are a lot of small issues where the designers settled for 90% as good enough. An example is the magnetic connector for charging the Pebble which disconnects too easily.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the technical restrictions inherently burred in the Bluetooth stack, but i would have put a lot of effort into the capability of maintaining connections to several other devices at the same time. But that leads to the next chapter.</p>
<h2 id="visions">VISIONS</h2>
<p>When I look at the Pebble, possible applications spring to my mind. Just two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the Pebble as input device for your Mac/PC, e.g. to control presentations. It would be rather easy to recognize gestures like next/previous slide.</li>
<li>As security device, the Pebble could provide one time passwords which can be combined with a PIN to log in or open doors through a connection with a lock.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not sure if the Pebble will manage to achieve its gigantic potential. Samsung has botched (admirable completely) their attempt at a Smartwatch. But soon someone will without doubt perform a SWOT analysis on the Pebble and incorporate the result in their products. At best, the makers of the Pebble have a year to achieve their own breakthrough.</p>
<h2 id="update-june-2020">Update (June 2020)</h2>
<p>I switched to the Apple Watch in April 2019. The primary reason was that the pebble watch was no longer actively maintained and I wanted more activity tracking features.</p>
